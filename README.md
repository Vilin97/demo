# Setup

You only need to follow these steps once. Afterwards, just open VSCode and open the codespace. It might take a few minutes for the codespace to spin up.

1. (Recommended) In Github --> Settings --> Codespaces --> Editor Preference select `Visual Studio Code`.
2. Create a new codespace (by clicking on `code` and then `Codespaces`.
3. Once VSCode opens, run command `lake exe cache get` **before** opening any `.lean` files. Wait for it to fully finish (should take <5 minutes).
4. Open any `.lean` file. make sure you get no errors in the infoview. If the infoview does open automatically, press the âˆ€ symbol in the top right corner of the `.lean` file and select `Infoview: Toggle Infoview`.
